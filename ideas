useful options for running on really old terminals:

the first thing is of course to limit the game's size, but it's already going to be small anyway
probably 10 lines or so by at least 30 columns? that'd easily fit 4 copies multiplexed on an 80x24 terminal

ascii-only mode
    example:
        A♠  K♥  Q♣  J♦ 10♦
        becomes
        As  Kh  Qc  Jd 10d
            maybe could be better?
        or maybe symobls?
        A%  K&  Q!  J* 10*
        typewriter backspace combining!??
        ^|  v"  |%  ^v  ^v

non-echoing input
    if someone really wants to play this on a real line printer or something idk
    extra option: ring the bell on accepting/rejecting input?
